# Contact Form for Bootstrap

This is just a simple PHP form using Bootstrap and the jQuery validation plugin. It should be easily adaptable to anything built with Bootstrap.

This is a work in progress but still usable as of now. Be sure to file any issues you find.

I kept all the less files with the same stuff as the official Bootstrap repo so it will be easy to pull in updates and just plop it into your existing Bootstrap-based site. Just add contact.less to the directory and add it to the end of bootstrap.less or whatever. I'll get better instructions written someday...
